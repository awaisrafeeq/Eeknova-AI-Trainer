**🖥️ Warm-Up UI Flow**

Dashboard

 → Yoga

   → Beginner

     → Warm-Up Screen

       → Deep Breathing

       → Neck Rolls

       → Arm Circles

       → Leg Stretch Side-to-Side

         → Main Yoga Poses

**UI notes:**

* Show **“Warm-Up 1/4 … 4/4”**

* Allow **Skip Warm-Up** (but show a small warning)

* Avatar remains **center / left**

* Lighting slightly brighter than main session

---

**2️⃣ Main Yoga Poses (Where Warm-Up Animations Are NOT Used)**

During the **10 core yoga poses**, none of these 6 animations are used directly.

Instead:

* Use **pose-specific animations** from Devant

* Use **idle breathing** between poses (no extra animation needed)

This keeps the experience focused and clean.

**3️⃣ Cool-Down Placement (After Main Yoga Poses)**

**🎯 Cool-Down Goal**

* Lower heart rate

* Release tension

* End session calmly

* Leave user feeling “taken care of”

| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
